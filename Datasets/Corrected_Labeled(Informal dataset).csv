"Possibly depends on where you start --like your genetics, where you are at in terms of weight and/or diet picks. When I hit obese 1 levels, even militarily monitoring food picks, the basics I had used previously like weight watchers etc just stopped showing results. Keto helped, very slowly. Carnivore helped, too. I was losing ounces in a month. Keto did heal a lot of absorption food issues so that now continues to be a blessing. Over several years, with high job stress, I couldn't keep glucose normalized. 6-8 hour 6 days a week hard workouts worked pretty well to continue the weight loss. Lost almost 30 pounds before this process went down to the ounces a month that the other options also gave me. Ultimately, wet or dry fasting became the final option that has worked for me. I am officially now a ""normal"" weight even by ""navy bmi"" evaluations but my doctors think I won't fully normalize insulin resistance until I hit around 22 bmi. So, the quest for controlling insulin resistance continues",2,,,,,,,,
